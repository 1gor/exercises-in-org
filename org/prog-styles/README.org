#+title: Exercises in Programming Style

*** About 

Here it can be found some exercises based from the /[[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1482227371][Exercises in Programming Styles]]/ book.

*** How to run an example

An example is meant to be run at the root level of the /Exercises in
Org/ repository so that the include directives from Org mode work as
expected.

There are several ways of running it:

**** Tangle and then run

By convention, I put the resulting tangled script under =src/=.
All documents describe how to run the implementation so we just need
to follow that:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
org-tangle org/prog-styles/03-monolith/python.org --showfiles | grep ".py"

---------- src/prog-styles/monolith-in-python/run.py --------------
python src/prog-styles/monolith-in-python/run.py
#+END_SRC

**** Directly with Org Converge

Org Converge makes a document runnable so it is possible to run the
document itself:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
org-run org/prog-styles/03-monolith/python.org 
#+END_SRC

Also each the main code block has matched expectations to check
whether it is reproducing the same results as the original version.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
org-spec org/prog-styles/03-monolith/python.org 

Checking results from 'monolith-in-python' code block:	OK
1 examples, 0 failures
#+END_SRC

In case the results are not expected, a diff would be shown:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
org-spec org/prog-styles/03-monolith/ruby.org 

Checking results from 'ruby-monolith' code block:	DIFF
